## Sidebar Ideas
Maybe I want a good looking artcore ish sidebar...

Very simple idea:
Home - for names, introduction and contact details

Everything under - one tab for each project.
just stealing designs the quickest.

Programming
- Github links to projects
- Pictures of projects

Music
- idk if I want a full playlist inside the webpage...

Art
- Non-existent (lol)

Notes
- Probably will be a subdomain that uses something like Quartz + Obsidian
